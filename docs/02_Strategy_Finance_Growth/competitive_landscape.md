# Competitive Landscape: David vs. Goliath

**Primary Rival**: Grab Car (The Monopoly)
**Secondary Rivals**: Angkas/JoyRide (Motorcycle Taxis), White Taxis

---

## 1. The Enemy: Grab Car

* **Strengths**: Massive fleet, dominance, user habit.
* **Weaknesses**:
  * **Price**: Extremely expensive (Surge pricing is hated).
  * **Wait Times**: High cancellation rates during peak hours.
  * **Quality**: Inconsistent vehicle quality (older Vios/Mirage units).

## 2. Our Edge: The "Loop" Model

We do not compete on coverage; we compete on **corridors**.

| Feature | Grab Car | Cebu Loop (BYD Seagull) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price** | High (Dynamic Surge) | **Fixed / Low** (Predictable) |
| **Asset** | Aging Gas Cars (Sedans) | **Brand New EVs** (Premium Micro) |
| **Vibe** | "Just a utility" | **"Tech Experience"** (Cool Factor) |
| **Availability** | Random | **Hub-Based** (Always at Ayala/Airport) |

## 3. The "Blue Ocean" Strategy

We avoid the traffic-choked inner city streets where Grab gets stuck. We focus on the **Airport <-> City Corridor** (CCLEX Bridge + SRP Coastal Road).

* **Why?**: EVs are most efficient in stop-and-go but shine on the expressway (smooth ride).
* **The Bridge**: We can cross the CCLEX bridge cheaper and faster (RFID ready).

## 4. Threat Response

* **If Grab lowers prices**: We hold firm. Our cost basis (electricity vs gas) is 70% lower. We can survive a price war; they can't (drivers will quit).
* **If Grab copies us (EV Fleet)**: They are slow to pivot. We have first-mover advantage on the specific "Loop" branding.
