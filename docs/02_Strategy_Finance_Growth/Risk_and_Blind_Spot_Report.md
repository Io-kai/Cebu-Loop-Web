# Risk & Blind Spot Report

**Status**: Active Monitoring
**Last Updated**: January 2026

---

## 1. Natural Disasters (Typhoons)

* **Risk**: Flooding and wind damage to parked EVs. Cebu is typhoon-prone (Nov-Dec).
* **Protocol "Safe Haven"**:
  * **Trigger**: PAGASA Signal No. 1.
  * **Action**: All cars pulled from street parking.
  * **Location**: Move to **Ayala Center Cebu - Level 5+** (Elevated) or **Marco Polo Hotel** (High ground).
  * **Cost**: Paying for overnight parking is cheaper than a flooded battery.

## 2. Regulatory Risk (LTO/LTFRB)

* **Risk**: "Colorum" (Illegal operation) crackdown.
* **Mitigation**:
  * **Provisional Authority (PA)**: Must be filed immediately. Carry PA papers in every glovebox.
  * **"Private Lease" Loophole**: If LTFRB delays, operate as "Long Term Lease" (Daily Car Rental) rather than "Taxi". Contracts must reflect "Lease" language, not "Fare".

## 3. Operational Risk (The "Dead Battery")

* **Risk**: Renter runs out of charge in the mountains (Busay/Tops).
* **Mitigation**:
  * **Geo-Fencing**: App warns user if they go beyond 40% range radius.
  * **Rescue Protocol**: Fleet Runner has a tow-hook ready motorcycle or contract with a towing company (Roadstar).

## 4. Asset Risk (Theft/Damage)

* **Risk**: Car stolen or parts (side mirrors) stolen.
* **Mitigation**:
  * **Teltonika Telematics**: Real-time tracking. Remote engine kill.
  * **Parts Marking**: Etch VIN on side mirrors to discourage theft.
  * **Dashcam**: Cloud-connected dashcams (70mai) inside and out.
