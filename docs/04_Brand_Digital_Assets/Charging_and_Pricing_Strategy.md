# Charging & Pricing Strategy

**Philosophy**: "Predictable Premium"
We are not the cheapest. We are the most predictable.

---

## 1. Passenger Fares (The "Loop Pass")

Unlike Grab (Dynamic), we charge per **Zone**.

| Zone | Route Description | Price (Flat) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zone A** | **Airport <-> City** (Via CCLEX/Coastal) | **₱650.00** |
| **Zone B** | **Intra-City** (Ayala <-> IT Park <-> SM) | **₱250.00** |
| **Zone C** | **Mountain Tour** (Tops/Temple of Leah) | **₱1,500.00** (3 Hours) |

* **Toll Fees**: Included in Zone A price (We use RFIDs).
* **Payment**: Credit Card / GCash Only (No Cash = Safer).

## 2. Charging Fees (For Public/Partners)

If we open our chargers to other BYD owners:

* **Rate**: ₱15.00 / kWh
* **Parking**: Free while charging (Max 2 hours).

## 3. Membership (The "Loop Club")

**Price**: ₱999 / month

* **Benefit 1**: 20% Discount on all rides.
* **Benefit 2**: Priority Booking (Jump the queue).
* **Benefit 3**: Free Airport Lounge Access (Partner pending).

## 4. Driver Incentives (The "Reverse Loop")

If a user is willing to drive the car themselves back to the Airport (Deadhead prevention):

* **Discount**: 50% OFF the fare.
* **Process**:
    1. User books "Self-Drive Loop".
    2. User unlocks car.
    3. User drops car at Airport Hub.
    4. Staff inspects.
