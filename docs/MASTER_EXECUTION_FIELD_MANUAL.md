# CEBU LOOP MOBILITY CORP: MASTER EXECUTION FIELD MANUAL

**Version:** 5.8 (Comprehensive)
**Date:** January 2026
**Location:** Cebu City
**Command Center:** Honolulu (Brian) & Cebu (Joy)

---

## 1. BUSINESS MODEL: SELF-DRIVE FIRST

> **STRATEGY**: Launch with **self-drive only** (customer drives, no driver provided). This **eliminates LTFRB franchise requirements** and allows launch in **6-8 weeks**.

| Phase | Model | LTFRB Required? |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| **Launch (Now)** | Self-Drive Only | ❌ NO |
| **Expansion (Later)** | Add Driver Option | ✅ YES (See Phase 5) |

**Legal Basis**: Self-drive car rentals where customers operate the vehicle for private use are not classified as public utility vehicles (PUVs) and do not require LTFRB franchise.
