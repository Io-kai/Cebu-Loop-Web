### Application Packet (4 Sets: 1 Original + 3 Photocopies)

* **Verified Application Form**: Requesting "Issuance of New CPC for Rent-a-Car Service".

* **Garage Docs**: Land Title/Lease + LGU Zoning + Map + Photos.
* **Unit Docs**: LTO OR/CR + Photos (with newspaper for date proof) + Stencils.
  * *No Unit Yet?* Use "Affidavit of Undertaking" regarding unit compliance if allowed, usually requires OR/CR for final PA.

### The Process (Region 7 Walk-In)

* **Scout**: Get checklist from Public Assistance Desk.
* **File**: Submit "Offer of Evidence".
* **Pay**: Filing Fees & Legal Research Fees.
* **Wait**: Receive "Notice of Hearing" and "Order of Payment".
* **Motion**: File "Motion for Issuance of Provisional Authority".

> [!WARNING]
