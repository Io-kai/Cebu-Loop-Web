## 4. GRANULAR FLEET OPERATIONS

### A. The Fleet Runner Logistics

- **Motorcycle**: The Runner uses their own motorcycle (125cc+). The company pays a ₱2,500/mo Rider Allowance + fuel.
- **Uniform**:
  - Front: "Cebu Loop Crew" Logo.
  - Back: Large QR Code ("Scan to Drive Me") for mobile marketing during cleaning sessions.
- **The Field Kit**:
  - **Vacuum**: Cordless Heavy Duty (e.g., Black+Decker Pivot). Runner carries two charged batteries.
  - **Sanitization**: Handheld UVC-C Wand + 70% Isopropyl Alcohol.
  - **Admin App**: Real-time SoC (State of Charge) and GPS monitoring.

### B. The "5-Star Clean" Protocol

1. **Runner arrives** within 45 mins of trip-end notification.
2. **De-trash**: Clear cabin.
3. **Power Vac**: 2-min blitz of floor/seats with the cordless vacuum.
4. **UVC Sweep**: 30-sec pass on all touchpoints (steering wheel, screen, handles).
5. **Reset**: Set AC to neutral, park in designated slot, plug in for top-up.

### C. Rebalancing & The "Airport Drain"

**The Problem**: High demand for Airport -> City travel leaves the Airport empty.

**Solution 1 (The Reverse Incentive)**: The App offers a 50% discount to any user willing to drive a car back to the Airport Hub.

**Solution 2 (The Deadhead Run)**:

1. Runner parks his motorcycle at the "Full" Hub (e.g., Ayala).
2. Runner drives the EV back to the "Empty" Hub (Airport).
3. Runner plugs the car in.
4. Runner takes an Angkas/JoyRide (Motorcycle Taxi) back to his bike at Ayala.
*Note: Company reimburses the Angkas fare. This is cheaper than a second employee.*
