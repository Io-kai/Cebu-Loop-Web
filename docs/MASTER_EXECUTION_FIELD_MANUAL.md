## 1. CAPITAL PRESERVATION STRATEGY (THE "MINIMAL-CAPEX" RULE)

**Location Strategy**:

* **Official Business Address**: Virtual Office (₱500-800/month)
  * Providers: KMC Solutions, The Company Cebu, Regus
  * Requirement: Business address + mail handling service
* **Meeting Space**: Use virtual office meeting rooms or hotel lobbies (pay-per-use)
* **Protocols**:
  * **NO** Commercial Leasing beyond virtual office until Fleet Acquisition
  * **NO** Long-term Lease Contracts
  * **NO** Capital Asset Purchases until Phase 0 is passed

* Supplies: ~₱500 (envelopes, pens, photocopies)
* Photos: ~₱200
* Cedula: ~₱50

## 2. CRITICAL STRATEGY: LTFRB REQUIREMENTS

> **⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING**: Self-drive car rentals (customer drives, no driver provided) generally do **NOT require an LTFRB franchise**. Only "rent-a-car WITH driver" (TNVS) requires LTFRB CPC.

### Business Model Decision

| Model | LTFRB Required? | Timeline Impact |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Self-Drive Only** | ❌ NO | Launch 4-6 weeks faster |
| **With Driver (TNVS)** | ✅ YES | +8-12 weeks for CPC |
| **Hybrid** | ✅ YES | Must apply for CPC |

**Recommendation**: Start with **Self-Drive Only** model to launch ASAP. Add driver service later once CPC is secured.

### If LTFRB IS Required (With-Driver Model)

**Expediting Strategies:**

1. **Apply for Provisional Authority (PA)** instead of full CPC
   * PA valid: 3 months - 1 year (renewable once)
   * Can operate legally while full CPC is processed
   * Processing: 30-45 days vs 90+ days for CPC

2. **Leverage EVIDA Law** (Electric Vehicle Priority)
   * EVs get **expedited franchise processing**
   * Priority registration with LTO
   * 100% excise tax exemption for BEVs
   * Mention "EVIDA Law RA 11697" in application

3. **Online Submission** via LTFRB Portal
   * Reduces processing from 90 to 60 days
   * Submit complete docs first time (incomplete = rejection)

4. **Required Documents for PA Application:**
   * [ ] 4 original copies of Verified Application Form
   * [ ] SEC Certificate of Incorporation
   * [ ] BIR Certificate of Registration (COR 2303)
   * [ ] Proof of Garage (Virtual Office Contract + Parking Contract)
   * [ ] Bank Certification (₱20,000 cash reserve per unit)
   * [ ] Vehicle OR/CR (can use Affidavit of Undertaking if not yet released)
   * [ ] 5R Vehicle Photos (front/back/sides + dated newspaper)
   * [ ] Passenger Personal Accident Insurance (₱4M coverage/unit)
