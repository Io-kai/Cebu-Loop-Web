Subject: Inquiry: Strategic EV Infrastructure Partnership (Cebu Loop Mobility)

To: <info@vecocorp.com>

Dear VECO Management,

We are launching Cebu Loop Mobility Corp, an electric-only vehicle sharing service. As we are deploying 5-25 EVs in the Cebu CBD, we seek to discuss:

1. **Commercial Charging Rates**: Grid connectivity for our DC Fast Charger hubs.
2. **Sustainability Partnership**: Co-branding opportunities as a "Green Cebu" initiative.

We look forward to aligning our rollout with VECO’s sustainability goals.

Best regards,

**Brian Shukri**
Treasurer, Cebu Loop Mobility Corp
