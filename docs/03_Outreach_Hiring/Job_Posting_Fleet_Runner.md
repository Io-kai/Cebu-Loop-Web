  * Monitor fleet battery levels via the Admin App.
  * Drive low-battery units to our DC Fast Charger for rapid top-ups.
  * Plug units into AC chargers at mall hubs.
* **Asset Inspection**: Conduct 360-degree checks for scratches, dents, or theft attempts and report digitally.
* **Emergency Response**: Assist with flat tires, customer lockouts, or typhoon relocation protocols.
