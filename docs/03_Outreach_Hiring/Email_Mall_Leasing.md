Subject: Proposal: Exclusive EV Amenity Partnership for [Mall Name] (EVIDA Compliance)

To: <strategic.leasing@ayalalandoffices.com.ph>, <leasing@smsupermalls.com>

Dear Leasing Manager,

My name is Brian Shukri, representing Cebu Loop Mobility Corp.

As per **RA 11697 (EVIDA Law)**, commercial establishments must designate parking for EVs. We propose leasing [3] dedicated slots in your EV zone to host Cebu's first station-based EV rental fleet.

**Benefits to [Mall Name]:**

1. **EVIDA Compliance**: Guaranteed utilization of mandatory EV slots.
2. **Premium Amenity**: A "green" alternative for your shoppers to run errands or attend meetings.
3. **Zero Cost**: We manage chargers, fleet, and insurance.

Are you available for a brief meeting next week to discuss lease terms?

Best regards,

**Brian Shukri**
Treasurer, Cebu Loop Mobility Corp
