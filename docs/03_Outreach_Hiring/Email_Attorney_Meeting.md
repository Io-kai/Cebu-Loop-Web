Subject: Engagement Inquiry: Corporate Formation & Shareholder Agreement (Cebu Loop Mobility Corp)

To: <info@accralaw.com>, <contact@cglaw.ph>

Dear Partners,

My name is Brian Shukri, and I am the primary investor/funder for Cebu Loop Mobility Corp, a station-based EV car-sharing startup launching in Cebu City.

We are seeking legal counsel to assist with:

1. **SEC Incorporation**: Setting up a domestic corporation with a specific 60/40 equity split.
2. **Shareholders' Agreement (SHA)**: Drafting a "Venture-Ready" SHA that includes Priority Repayment of a Shareholder Loan, Anti-Dilution clauses, and specific Veto powers for the Treasurer (Brian Shukri).
3. **LTFRB/LTO Compliance**: Advisory on "Rent-a-Car" franchise applications under the EVIDA Law framework.

We are looking to finalize our legal partner within the next 10 days. Could you please provide your standard fee schedule for a startup incorporation package?

Best regards,

**Brian Shukri**
Treasurer, Cebu Loop Mobility Corp
