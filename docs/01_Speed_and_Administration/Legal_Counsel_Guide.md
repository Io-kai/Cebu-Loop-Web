# Legal Counsel Guide: When & How to Hire

## Philosophy: "Lean Compliance"

We do not hire lawyers for things we can do ourselves (e.g., standard filing). We hire them for **Architecture**, **Defense**, and **Complex Compliance**.

## 🚦 Triggers: When to Hire (The "Red Lines")

Do not engage counsel until one of these triggers is met.

### 1. The "Co-Founder Conflict" Trigger

* **Condition**: If the Shareholders Agreement (SHA) involves complex vesting, anti-dilution, or non-standard board seats that standard templates can't cover.
* **Action**: Hire a Corporate Lawyer for "SHA Review only" (Fixed Fee).

### 2. The "Franchise Denial" Trigger

* **Condition**: If the LTFRB application receives a "Notice of Defect" that is legally complex or if there is a moratorium we need to appeal.
* **Action**: Hire an "Accredited Liaison" or Transportation Lawyer immediately.

### 3. The "Fundraising" Trigger (Series A)

* **Condition**: Taking outside institutional money (VCs).
* **Action**: Mandatory external counsel to review Term Sheets.

## 🗣️ Script: Hiring & Management

When interviewing potential attorneys, use this script to filter for "Founder-Friendly" vs "Billable-Hour" firms.

### The Interview Script
>
> "We are a bootstrapped transport tech startup. We handle all ground-level admin (SEC/BIR/LGU) ourselves. We are looking for a **Retainer-based** relationship specifically for **High-Level Advisory** and **Crisis Management**. Do you have experience with **LTFRB franchises** specifically?"

### The Questions to Ask

1. **"Do you charge a flat project fee for Franchise Applications, or is it hourly?"**
    * *Good Answer*: "We have a package for P30k-50k."
    * *Bad Answer*: "It depends on the hours spent." (Avoid).
2. **"Can we draft the documents using your templates and just pay you to review?"**
    * *Goal*: This saves 70% of the cost.
3. **"What is your success rate with LTFRB Region 7 specifically?"**
    * *Goal*: You want local influence, not a Manila lawyer who knows nobody in Cebu.

## 📂 Scope of Work (What to Assign vs. DIY)

| Task | Who Does It? | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SEC Registration** | **Founders (DIY)** | ESPARC is digital and straightforward. Save P50k. |
| **Mayor's Permit** | **Founders (DIY)** | Just queuing. No legal brain needed. |
| **Shareholders Agreement** | **Counsel (Review)** | High risk if wrong. Draft it, then pay for specific review. |
| **LTFRB Hearing** | **Counsel/Liaison** | Requires "Motion for Provisonal Authority" which is a legal pleading. |
| **Lease Contracts** | **Founders (DIY)** | Use standard commercial templates. |

## Recommended Fee Structure

* **Retainer**: Avoid if possible early on.
* **Project-Based**: Preferred. "P20,000 for SHA Review" or "P50,000 for LTFRB Acceptance".
