# LTFRB Application Guide: The "Cebu Loop" Strategy

## Context & Strategy

Since **Cebu Loop** utilizes "Fleet Runners" (Chauffeur-driven service), our operations fall under **"Rent-a-Car Service" (with Driver)** or potentially **TNVS** (if using a ride-hailing app platform). Pure "Self-Drive" rentals are less regulated, but our "Premium Chauffeur" model requires an LTFRB Franchise to avoid "Colorum" violations.

**Our Goal**: Secure a **Provisional Authority (PA)** immediately (allows operation for 90 days) while the full **Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC)** processes (takes 3-6 months).

## 🚀 The Rapid Pathway (Provisional Authority)

**Goal**: Get cars on the road in Week 9 (Integration).
**Target**: LTFRB Region 7 Office (Cebu City).

### 1. The Pre-Requisites (Have these ready from Week 1-6)

These are your "Blockers". You cannot file without them.

- [ ] **SEC Certificate of Incorporation** (from Week 3)
- [ ] **BIR Certificate of Registration** (2303) (from Week 3)
- [ ] **Bank Certificate of Deposit** (Paid-up Capital, min. P50k-100k) (from Week 1)
- [ ] **Proof of Garage**: The most common blocker.
  - *Requirement*: Location Map + TCT (Title) OR Notarized Lease Contract.
  - *Strategy*: Use the "Home Office" (Marco Polo) or lease a small lot/garage space specifically for this requirement if Marco Polo doesn't allow it.
- [ ] **LTO OR/CR**: The Official Receipt & Certificate of Registration for the BYD Seagulls.
  - *Note*: Ensure they are named under "Cebu Loop Mobility Corp".

### 3. "No Unit Yet?" - The Chicken & Egg Strategy

**Can we apply without buying the cars?**
- **Technically, No**: The LTFRB generally requires the LTO OR/CR to prove you have units.
- **The Workaround**: Use the **"Affidavit of Undertaking"** if units are under financing.
  - *Concept*: You submit the bank approval and a sworn statement that you *will* submit the OR/CR before the actual franchise is released. This *might* allow you to get the Hearing set, but you usually need the OR/CR for the actual Provisional Authority (PA) to be signed.
- **The "EVIDA Law" (RA 11697) Ace Card**:
  - *Leverage*: Electric Vehicle operators are entitled to **Expedited Processing**.
  - *Action*: When filing, explicitly state: *"This is a 100% Electric Fleet Application entitled to priority processing under RA 11697."* Print a copy of the law's relevant section to attach to your folder.

### 2. The Application Packet (Provisional Authority)

Prepare **4 Sets** (1 Original + 3 Photocopies) of the following:

1. **Verified Application Form**: Requesting "Issuance of New CPC for Rent-a-Car Service".
2. **Affidavit of Undertaking**: Standard legal form promising to comply with rules.
3. **Operator's Data Sheet**: Details of the corporation and units.
4. **Legal Docs**: SEC Cert, Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws.
5. **Financial Docs**: Bank Certificate + Latest ITR (or Affidavit of New Business if no ITR yet).
6. **Garage Docs**: Land Title/Lease + LGU Zoning Clearance (sometimes required) + Map + Photos of Garage.
7. **Unit Docs**: LTO OR/CR + Photos of Units (Front/Side/Back) + Stencil of Chassis/Engine.
    - *Hack*: The photos must include a **current newspaper** in the frame to prove the date.

## 🚦 The Process: Efficient Execution

### Option A: The "Walk-In" (Region 7) - Recommended for Speed

**Location**: LTFRB Region 7, 2nd Floor, J. King Bldg, Jose L. Briones St, Cebu City (Check current address as they sometimes move).

1. **Day 1 (Scouting)**: Visit the office *without* the full packet just to get the "Checklist of Requirements" from the Public Assistance Desk. Confirm if they accept "Rent-a-Car" applications currently (sometimes moratoria exist, though rare for Rent-a-Car).
2. **Day 3 (Filing)**: Submit the "Offer of Evidence" (The 4 sets).
3. **Payment**: Pay the Filing Fee and Legal Research Fee.
4. **Order of Payment**: Get the "Order of Payment" for the Provisional Authority.
5. **Motion for PA**: Simultaneously file a "Motion for Issuance of Provisional Authority".
6. **Hearing Date**: You will receive a "Notice of Hearing".

> [!TIP]
> **Efficiency Hack**: If you hire a "Liaison Officer" or "Accredited Processor" (often found near LTFRB offices), they can expedite the checking of documents. For a Founder-led speed run, Brian/Joy can do it, but expect a full day of queuing.

### Option B: Online (LTFRB-ITIS)

*Note: Reliability varies by Region. Verify if Region 7's portal accepts Rent-A-Car applications.*

- **Portal**: [LTFRB Public Transportation Online Processing System](https://ltfrb.gov.ph/) (Check specifically for Region 7 links).

## ⚠️ Important "Gotchas" (The Founder's Warnings)

1. **The "Colorum" Trap**: Operating with a driver *before* the PA is issued is illegal (Colorum). Fine is P200,000 per van/car. Do not launch field ops until the PA paper is in hand.
2. **Insurance**: You need **PAMI (Passenger Accident Management and Insurance)** or equivalent *LTFRB-accredited* insurance. Your standard comprehensive insurance is NOT enough for the franchise. You need the specific "Passenger Personal Accident Insurance" (PPAI).
3. **GPS**: LTFRB usually requires GPS installation from an accredited provider. Since we are using Teltonika, check if our provider is LTFRB-accredited. If not, we might need a "Certificate of Conformity" or switch to an accredited one for the compliance layer.

## Action Plan for Joy (Week 6-8)

1. **Scout**: Go to LTFRB Region 7 (Cebu) to get the *exact* 2026 Checklist.
2. **Garage**: Secure the Lease Contract/Letter of Authority for the Garage.
3. **Compile**: Assemble the "4 Sets" of folders.
