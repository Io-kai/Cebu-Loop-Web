# Team Availability & Operational Windows

## Context

To maximize speed and efficiency, we must build our operations around the rigid constraints of our team's schedule. This document serves as the "Source of Truth" for scheduling meetings, bank visits, and government transactions.

**Principle**: "Field Work First, Desk Work Later." We use the Golden Hours for external tasks that require business hours.
